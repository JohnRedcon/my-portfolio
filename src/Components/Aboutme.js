        Currently studying Systems Development at WeThinkCode_. I am looking forward to embarking the Tech world and experience what it can offer me and how I can ultimately use
         to it to change how my community views and uses technology to improve their everyday lives. 
I want to implement ways in which can make an impact in my community through identifying what services can be made easy by implementing easier ways to do them via tech. 
I am passionate about helping the disadvantaged by helping them become better versions of themselves, equipping them with skills and knowledge from what I've learned and learn from them also.
