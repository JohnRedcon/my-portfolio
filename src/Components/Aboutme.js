        Currently studying Software Development at WeThinkCode_. I am looking forward to embarking the Tech world and experience what it can offer me and how I can ultimately use
         to it to change how my community views and uses technology to improve their everyday lives. 
I want to implement ways in which can make an impact in my community through identifying what services can be made easy by implementing easier ways to do them via tech. 
I am passionate about helping the disadvantaged by helping them become better versions of themselves, equipping them with skills and knowledge from what I've learned and learn from them also. 
My ultimate goal is teaching people about the importance of tech, and platforms they can use to study programming, I wish to have a platform of my own where I'll share my experiences and 
how I got into programming and help people from my community and neighbouring communities learn to program.

          Like your #Adapt spex,I too belive that one should be able to adapt to changes, I think its important to be able to explore new avenues and find your niche.
          I am a tech fanatic, but it hasnt alway been that way, my love for tech developed when I was in varsity and I had a Programming module and we had to build a calculator and create a website promoting it, 
          ever since then I've wanted to be a part of a world of endless possibilities. 
          I believe with tech anything is possible, with tech we can build cutting edge softwares that will help improve our daily lives.
          I relate with your #Sorted spex because I never leave anything incomplete, I always ensure that a task is completed, if I don't have the solution to fix it then I go out and outsource help.
          I want to be apart of a company that is at a world class level, that actually makes tangible change to the tech industry and that cares about their customers and clients.

          I believe that Sovtech will equipt me with the neccesary tools to enhance my skills, I believe that I am an excellent culture fit and will fit in easily. 
          Where I lack as a developer I believe that I will acquire it through the graduate program.
